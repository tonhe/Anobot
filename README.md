# Anobot
Slack Announcements Channel Bot
# DESCRIPTION
This bot replaces functionality from stacktodo, allowing you to build a list of authorized users (using a custom slack group) that are allowed to post in one, or more channels. Any unauthorized posts are deleted by the bot. This requires use of a admin user with a legacy token, as bot plugins are not allowed to modifiy other users messages. That user must also be in the channel being monitored. See variables in script for more info.
